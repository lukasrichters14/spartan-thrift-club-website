      <h3>Alec Said - Director of Membership</h3>
      <p>Alec is a junior pursuing a dual major in Electrical and Computer Engineering. His favorite
        hobbies consist of spending time with friends, playing D&D, Improv, and using the Oxford
        comma. Some of his greatest fears include the Thrift Club President, writing bios/cover
        letters and not using the Oxford comma. When Alec was fourteen, he discovered that his
        estranged father was secretly a vigilante working against the Russian mafia, this discovery
        quickly proved devastating to the small gang of rag tag friends he managed to scrape
        together; Alec, too, may not have survived if not for the hella cool shoes he recently
        thrifted.</p>
